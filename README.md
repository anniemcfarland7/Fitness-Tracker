#Fitness Tracker

## Description 

Fitness Tracker is an application that uses Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handles routes with Express.
Users will be able to view, create, and track daily workouts. Multiple exercises in a workout can be logged on a given day. For resistance exercises, the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise will be recorded. For cardio exercises, the distance traveled and duration of exercise will be recorded.
On the Dashboard page, the user can view graphs of the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts.
With this application, a consumer will be able to reach their fitness goals more quickly by tracking their progress.
